What is Opp
- to break complex problems into smaller objects

what are objects(we will get back to this after class )
- they can also be thought of instances of classes
- objects are entity that has a state and behavior
    - a bike is an object

What is a class?
- we cna think of a class as a blueprint for an object.
- using that blue print we can create many objects
- classes contain two things, fields and methods  (which are also called members) 
    - fields
        - these variables that store data
    - methods
        - these are functions that perform some specific operation

    - EX:
        -class Bicycle {

           // state or field
           private int gear = 5;
           // behavior or method
           public void braking() {
                System.out.println("Working of Braking");
           }
        }

Getting back to objects
    - we have said objects are instance of classes lets see how..
    - in the above example we have seen "Bicycle" as a class (a blueprint for other houses)
    - if we were to create an object/instances from that classes lets say for the different kinds of bikes
    - it would look something like this...
        - sporting && touringBicycle ex:
            - Bicycle sportBicycle = new Bicycle();
            - Bicycle touringBicycle = new Bicycle();
    - so if we see the above example we have:
        - class name
        - folloed by the new object/instance created from that class
        - equal
        - new (creating the new objct)
        - the Bicycle() constructor
         classname objct = new constructor()
